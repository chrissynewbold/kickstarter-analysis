# Kickstarter Challenge

## Overview of Project
- This project is analyzing the data of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for theater and plays as well, as other data points with different categories of entertainment.

### Purpose of Project
- The purpose of this analysis is to assist the client with how best to approach their next project for theater/plays to be able to find the right amount of funding to be successful.

## Analysis of Challenges
- I performed these analyses by creating charts for analyzing the successful, failed, and canceled theater and plays across the world.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was that by month the most successful theaters were between May and July. The least susccesful month was Decmeber.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals was that the highest numbers of successful plays were with goal amounts between $0 and $4999. The data is skewed to be that the number of successful and number of failed plays were with the lower goal amounts and as the goal amounts increase the total number of overall plays decreased.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- Challenges and Difficulties encountered were analyzing the correct data points that would be useful for the client to be able to come to a conclusion for their own goal amounts and needs for a successful theater/play. There was some playing around with the data points to make sure the correct dtat was being used.

## Results

- Two conclusions about the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date are that overall there are a larger number of successful theater campaign than there are failed ones and that the most successul theater campaigns happen between May and July.

- Conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals is that when the goal amount is on the lower end, under $4999, that there is a hugher percentage of successful plays.

- Some limitations of this dataset are that there is a lot of data coming from different countries and areas of catergories that may influence the overall numbers that could affect the needs of the client's project.

- Some other tables or graphs that could be created are ones based on country of origin and outcome of successful campaigns to show the difference between the countries and their success rate.
