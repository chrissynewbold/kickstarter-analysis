Recommend that the goals for the theater kickstarter be set at a reasonable number such as $5,000 based on the mean goal for successful kickstarters and the pledged amount of a mean around $5600 being over the goal total. The failed kickstarters had a high goal of a mean around $10,000 and the mean amount pledged being much lower at a mean of around $500.
